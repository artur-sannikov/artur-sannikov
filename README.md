I'm Artur, a doctoral researcher in computational biology and food sciences at
University of Turku, Finland. My research is about the impact of plant-based
food products on human gut and metabolism. Here is my group on
[GitHub](https://github.com/hanhineva-lab) and [our
website](https://hanhinevalab.utu.fi/).

I like doing reproducible science and automating boring stuff. Most of my
machines run [NixOS](https://github.com/artur-sannikov/nixos)! My
[homelab/homeprod](https://github.com/artur-sannikov/homelab) is managed with
Ansible and renovate.

I contribute to [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).
